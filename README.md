# Turn-The-Based
Turn Based Strategy Game loosely based on Disgaea

## Gameplay

This is a two player, turn-based strategy game. The goal is to defeat the opponents Ruler, which can be done by purchasing units.  
Both players get 500 gold with which they can purchase troops.  
You can purchase different Rarities of units; Normal, Magic and Rare.  
Magic and Rare units will receive Traits which will put them apart from the Normal units. 
Magic units receive a single trait while Rare units receive two.  
When you purchase a unit, you will gain a random unit.

The game has 5 different units.

1. Ruler: Weak unit, if he dies it's game over.
2. Acolyte: Magical unit, can cast fireball. Has high INT and RES.
3. Rogue: Precision unit. Has high PRC and AGI. Makes him very hard to hit.
4. Esquire: Footsoldier unit. Has decent stats all around.
5. Brute: Rampage unit. Has high STR and HP, but is very easy to hit.

The game will keep going until either of the Rulers is defeated.
